There are two varients of Friendchat.

**Friendchat-small**

**Friendchat-large**

Friendchat-small contains around 50 lines of the basic training data. (This runs faster on older cpus.)

Friendchat-large contains 70 lines of basic training data. (This also runs on older cpus but also on a beefy cpu.)

Friendchat does not require a GPU as it mainly uses CPU instead of GPU.
